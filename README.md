Shell commands, project and notes

1) Shell script file should always be saved with extension '.sh'
2) The first line of file is '#!/bin/bash'. It tells interpreter that from here onwards you have to read the commands and execute it.
3) You execute file using command './ifelse_example.sh' or '$sh ifelse_example.sh'. If we it is not allowing to run this command then it is because the script does not have executable permission. You can change permission using '$chmod 744 ifelse_example.sh'
